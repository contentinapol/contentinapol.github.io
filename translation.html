              <h2>Academic translation and editing</h2>
              <p>
                As Contentinapol team, we appreciate that academic research is an indispensable 
                part of society and it paves the way for creating a world where we can get to 
                live a wealthier and a more prosper life altogether.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, as in all different walks of life, academic research and more particularly 
                academic writing brings certain difficulties. As a team with members of solid 
                academic background, we claim even further that academic writing is just another 
                language because it has its own distinct rules, structure, and parlance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides, the competition in academic world grows increasingly, if not overwhelmingly 
                for some! And, all this competition and technicality as of academic writing naturally 
                necessitates help and counseling for academicians who have difficulties in overcoming 
                problems regarding language barriers (that is trying to write in another language in 
                both senses) and pro-creating structurally and academically sound papers. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Here we are ready to help you with every possible obstacles you may encounter in 
                your academic life, from translating your academic documents and writings to 
                proofreading and “academically” adjusting your works.
              </p>
              <p>
                The enthusiastic and experienced members of our team offer you a high quality 
                service for professional academic translation and editing. They are also 
                well-versed in providing academic writing services for your research proposals, 
                term papers, and assignments in order to help you rise your academic career.

              <h2>Medical translation</h2>
              <p>
                Medical translation covers a vast area from pharmaceutical to medicine. It 
                plays a great role in spreading the findings of this maybe the most “vital” 
                science across the world. Plus, in an ever-changing world where medicine and 
                industry branches such as pharmaceutical industry go through rapid improvements 
                and globalization processes, the importance of Medical translations grows 
                bigger and bigger. Taking translation of a generic medical equipment user 
                manual, it can be shown that a potential mistake may affect tens of people’s 
                lives due to probable mistakes in translation and subsequent misuses in 
                medicinal practices. It is just like “error of propagation” explaining 
                that a simple error in the process complicates and expands along the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, it is a highly specialized realm of translation and we believe 
                that merely the translators who has got a solid medical and/or related background 
                should in charge in these kind of projects.  
              </p>
              <p>
                With the gravity of the job being kept in mind, we “cautiously” and “adeptly” 
                provide Medical translation services including but not limited medical 
                documents, patient information handouts, hospital (examination) reports, lab 
                results, cutting-edge publications from academic and industrial world, and 
                medical articles. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, it is important to remark here that we narrowed down the language 
                pairs that we provide translation services for because it is much more 
                important for us to keep team members of high-experienced and expert than 
                increasing simply “numbers” of members along with language pair quantity. 
                Shortly, here we emphasize our motto “quality over quantity”. The language 
                pairs for which we provide service is English-Turkish, Italian-English, 
                and Turkish-Italian.

              <p>
                As of 2021, it is known that there are approximately 1.35 billion of 
                English speakers in the world. Although this figure is quite high, that 
                still means that around only 20% of world population speak English. 
                And, you simply overlook and miss out automatically thousands and maybe 
                millions of potential viewers. The incorporation of an effective 
                translation service for videos make your viewers feel connected.
              </p>
